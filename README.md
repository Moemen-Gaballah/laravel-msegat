This is a package for [msegat](https://msegat.docs.apiary.io/).
Its goal is to remove the complexity.


## Installation


```shell
composer require moemengaballah/msegat
```

Laravel uses Package Auto-Discovery, so doesn't require you to manually add the ServiceProvider.

### Laravel version less than 5.5:

If you don't use auto-discovery, add the ServiceProvider to the providers array in config/app.php

```php
MoemenGaballah\Msegat\MsegatServiceProvider::class,
```

If you want to use the facade to log messages, add this to your facades in app.php:

```php
'Msegat' => MoemenGaballah\Msegat\Msegat::class,
```

#### Copy the package config to your local config with the publish command:

```shell
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="msegat"
```

## Usage

You must add first API Credentials in file env

```php
MSEGAT_USERNAME=
MSEGAT_USER_SENDER=
MSEGAT_API_KEY=
```

## Example

```php
// numbers (required, string, international format without zeros separated by comma, example: "966xxxxxxxxx" or "966xxxxxxxxx,966xxxxxxxxx,966xxxxxxxxx")
//Msegat::sendMessage('numbers', 'MSG'); 
use Msegat;

$msg = Msegat::sendMessage('966xxxxxxxxx', 'رمز التحقق: 1234');

dd($msg);

```

```php
// another example 
Route::get('/', function () {
    $msg = Msegat::sendMessage('966xxxxxxxxx', 'رمز التحقق: 1234');
